# BasicDataStructures
Useful codes of some basic data structures using C

This repository contains useful code sources of some basic data structures such as Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, etc. Most of them are written in C language and I wrote these by myself. 

As I was programming these, I referred to the textbook "Ellis Horowitz et al., Fundamentals of Data Structures in C, 2nd edition, 
Silicon Press, 2007" and some external power point representation files of Professor Jung-Min So, which are given during the course "Data Structures" in the first semester in Sogang Univ.
